- 👋 Hi, it's me, Mario!
- 👀 I’m interested in awesome projects (small or big) to collaborate in and increase my coding proficiency and architect skills!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and all the cool features .NET Core 3 has to offer, and also exploring Blazor.
- 💞️ I’m also looking to collaborate on AI projects that involves coding in the cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP, you name it).
