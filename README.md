- 👋 Hi, it's me, Mario!
- 👀 I’m interested in projects (small or big) to collaborate on and increase my coding proficiency and architecting skills!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Java and Python, and all the cool features .NET Core, Spring and Django offers.
- 💞️ I’m also looking to collaborate on projects that involves coding in the cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP, you name it).
